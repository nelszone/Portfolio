                <p><b>Real-User Monitoring System</b><br>
                    RUM (pronounced like every pirate’s favorite beverage) is, as its name implies, an approach to Web monitoring that aims to capture and analyze every transaction of every user of your website or application. Also known as real-user measurement, real-user metrics, or end-user experience monitoring (EUM), it’s a form of passive monitoring, relying on Web-monitoring services that continuously observe your system in action, tracking availability, functionality, and responsiveness.

            <p>An "about me" section of a resume is a portion of the resume that describes the candidate's skills, experience and education. You typically position this section near the top of a resume for easy viewing before introducing your qualifications or work history.

                The "about me" section is typically one to three paragraphs long and includes aspects such as education, professional experience, personal interests and responsibilities outside work. It also includes an overview of why you are interested in the specific position or industry.</p>
